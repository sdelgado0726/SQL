## This project was completed as part of Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course. I created two tables regarding singers, which included data about the singer's
name, age, and genre. Additionally, I used JOIN sunctions to display information from both tables created (singers and popularity).

# Created a singers table that represents data such as name, age, and genre.
CREATE TABLE singers
(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
name TEXT,
age INTEGER,
genre TEXT
);

# Created data to add to the singers table.
INSERT INTO
    singers (name, age, genre) VALUES ("Rose", 25, "K-pop");
INSERT INTO
    singers (name, age, genre) VALUES ("Jisoo", 28, "K-pop");
INSERT INTO
    singers (name, age, genre) VALUES ("Harry Styles", 28, "Pop");
INSERT INTO
    singers (name, age, genre) VALUES ("Olivia Rodrigo", 19, "Pop");
INSERT INTO
    singers (name, age, genre) VALUES ("Dua Lipa", 27, "Pop");

# Selected all from singers to review the entire table.
SELECT * FROM singers;

# Created a popularity table that represents data such as singers_id, net_worth, and insta_followers.
CREATE TABLE popularity
(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
singers_id INTEGER,
net_worth INTEGER,
insta_followers INTEGER
);

# Created data to add to the popularity table.
INSERT INTO
    popularity (singers_id, net_worth, insta_followers) VALUES (1, 18000000, 37000000);
INSERT INTO
    popularity (singers_id, net_worth, insta_followers) VALUES (2, 20000000, 67000000);
INSERT INTO
    popularity (singers_id, net_worth, insta_followers) VALUES (3, 120000000, 47900000);
INSERT INTO
    popularity (singers_id, net_worth, insta_followers) VALUES (4, 5000000, 29100000);
INSERT INTO
    popularity (singers_id, net_worth, insta_followers) VALUES (5, 35000000, 87700000);
    
# Selected all from popularity to review the entire table.
SELECT * FROM popularity;

# What is the networth of each singer?
SELECT singers.name, popularity.net_worth FROM singers
INNER JOIN popularity
ON singers.id = popularity.singers_id
ORDER BY popularity.net_worth DESC;

# Which singers have 40,000,000 or more followers?
SELECT singers.name, popularity.insta_followers FROM singers
INNER JOIN popularity
ON singers.id = popularity.singers_id
WHERE popularity.insta_followers >= 40000000
ORDER BY popularity.insta_followers DESC;

# How many singers have an instagram following less than or equal to 10,000,000 and under 25 years of age?
SELECT singers.name, singers.age, popularity.net_worth FROM singers
INNER JOIN popularity
ON singers.id = popularity.singers_id
WHERE popularity.net_worth <= 10000000 AND singers.age <25;
