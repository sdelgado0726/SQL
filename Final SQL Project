#In this project I pulled info from a database named chinook that contained data from a digital media store. I query the database to answer questions about artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT
CustomerId,
FirstName,
LastName,
Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT
c.FirstName,
c.LastName,
i.InvoiceId,
i.InvoiceDate,
i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT
e.FirstName,
e.LastName,
i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT
c.FirstName as Customer_FirstName,
c.LastName as Customer_LastName,
c.Country,
e.FirstName as SalesAgent_fn,
e.LastName as SalesAgent_ln,
i.InvoiceId,
i.total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT
SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT
i.InvoiceLineId,
t.Name
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
ORDER BY i.InvoiceLineId ASC;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT
i.InvoiceLineId,
t.Name as TrackName,
art.Name as Artist
FROM chinook.artists art
JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON art.ArtistId = alb.ArtistId
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON alb.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
ORDER BY i.InvoiceLineId ASC;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT
track.Name as Track,
alb.Title as Album,
m.Name as Media_Type,
g.Name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks track
JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON track.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = track.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreId = track.GenreId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT
e.FirstName,
e.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT
e.FirstName,
e.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
